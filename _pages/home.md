## Brief Bio
Alex Kendall is an award-winning artificial intelligence researcher and global technology leader. He is the CEO of [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/), a start-up pioneering AV2.0: the next-generation approach to autonomous driving that can quickly and safely adapt to new driving domains anywhere in the world. Alex has raised over $258m, leads a team of world-class technologists and was named on the 2020 [Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/profile/alex-kendall/?list=30under30-europe-big-money-startups#1b95c2317283) list for contributions to technology entrepreneurship. Alex was awarded his PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where he studied as a [Woolf Fisher Scholar](http://www.woolffishertrust.co.nz/) and was elected a Research Fellow at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/). Following his highly-cited and award-winning [research](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hE2mTp4AAAAJ), he founded Wayve in 2017. Wayve was the first team to deploy autonomous vehicles on public roads with end-to-end deep learning, showing it is possible to drive with a data-driven solution using a lean sensor and compute stack. In 2022, Wayve [began commercial pilots](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/01/18/start-up-plans-driverless-deliveries-ocado-asda-year/) of this technology on UK roads and ultimately aims to be the first team to deploy autonomy in 100 cities.
