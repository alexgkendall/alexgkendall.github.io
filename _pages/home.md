## Brief Bio
Alex Kendall is an award-winning artificial intelligence researcher and global technology leader. He is the CEO of [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/), a start-up pioneering AV2.0: the next-generation approach to autonomous driving. Alex has raised over $258m from prominent global financial investors and leads a global team of world-class technologists. He was named on the 2020 [Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/profile/alex-kendall/?list=30under30-europe-big-money-startups#1b95c2317283) list for contributions to technology entrepreneurship. Wayve was the first team to deploy autonomous vehicles on public roads with end-to-end deep learning and aims to be the first to deploy autonomy in 100 cities. Alex was a Research Fellow at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where he completed his PhD as a [Woolf Fisher Scholar](http://www.woolffishertrust.co.nz/). Following his highly-cited and award-winning [research](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hE2mTp4AAAAJ), he founded Wayve in 2017 with the belief that now is the right time to embody artificial intelligence in the real world to reimagine autonomous mobility.
