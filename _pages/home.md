## Brief Bio
Alex Kendall is an award-winning researcher and technology leader who is building artificial intelligence systems that are embodied in the physical world. He is the co-founder and CEO of [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/), a London-based start-up pioneering a new approach to autonomous driving: AV2.0. Wayve has raised $60m and is a team of world-leading technologists who are the first to deploy next generation self-driving technology that can scale and adapt to any driving condition, anywhere in the world, unlocking the promise of autonomy. Additionally, Alex is a research fellow at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where he completed his PhD as a [Woolf Fisher Scholar](http://www.woolffishertrust.co.nz/). Alex's [research](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hE2mTp4AAAAJ) has appeared at leading computer vision, robotics and machine learning conferences, is the recipient of [UK](https://britishmachinevisionassociation.github.io/bursaries/sullivan-prize.html) and [European](https://ellis.eu/en/news/ellis-phd-award) awards for scientific impact. He has been selected on the Royal Academy of Engineering's [SME Leaders Programme](https://enterprisehub.raeng.org.uk/hub-central/news/twelve-new-engineering-innovators-welcomed-hubs-sme-leaders-programme/) and named on the [Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/profile/alex-kendall/?list=30under30-europe-big-money-startups#1b95c2317283) list.
